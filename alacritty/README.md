# Alacritty

Here you will find the `alacritty.toml` which replace the `alacratty.yaml` configuration file. both files has the same configuration with maybe small changes mades in the toml which is the most recent one.

Also here is the `toggle_alacritty_opacity file`, this is a script that i use for iterate between  different levels of background opacity (0.4, 0.82, 1). This script can be called from a bash alias or any other method, for example: `alias ewq=/path/toggle_alacritty_opacity`
